The program for a given square matrix of size n checks whether it's possible to somehow change the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix so that its rank becomes <= 1.

Program input data: The first line contains a natural number n - the size of a square matrix. The following n lines contain the matrix itself without spaces.

Program output: "Yes" - if by some change of elements on the main diagonal it is possible to get a matrix M with rk M <= 1. "No" - otherwise.

Asymptotics of the program O(n^2).
