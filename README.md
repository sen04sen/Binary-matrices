The program for a given square matrix of size n checks whether it is possible to change some entries on the main diagonal of a matrix so that its rank becomes <= 1.

Program input data: The first line contains an integer n, i.e., the size of the square matrix. The following n lines are the rows of the matrix itself without spaces.

Program output data: "Yes", if by some change of entries on the main diagonal it is possible to get a matrix of rank at most 1. "No" - otherwise.

Asymptotics of the complexity of the program O(n^2).
